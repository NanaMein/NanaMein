## 🚀 Current MVP Spotlight: Miako App

I am currently refactoring and building a robust LLM backend designed for scalability and handling large internet traffic **while maintaining peak performance.**

**Goal:** A high-concurrency LLM Routed Workflow capable of handling voice and text for customer service replying in secs for better user experience (UX). Also able to understand Generation Z terms, catch up with modern slang and expressions, and able to understand context and words outside the English language.

- **Tech:** FastAPI (Async + Threadpool + SQLModel), LlamaIndex RAG, JWT Tokens, Groq AI SDK, Crew AI Flow  

> *Building the engine that powers the next generation of automated support.*
